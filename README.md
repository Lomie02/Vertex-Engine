# Vertex-Engine-2

Vertex is a custom built C++ 2D game engine with OpenGL. This engine is a project I created to test my skills & improve them, I am very passionate about this project & hope to create something special.
The engine is inspired by Unreal Engine & Unity. Vertex Engine 2 is planned to fix all current issues in Vertex & improve existing systems to be better. 

# Vertex Engine 1 Features:
- Simple Animation System
- Object Instancing
- Audio System
- Simple Editor
- Simple UI
- Vertex2D Render Pipeline (Default lightweight Renderer)
- Tension2D Render Pipeline (Advanced Renderer)
- Layer Sorting (Tension2D)
- Transparent Renderering (Tension2D)

# Vertex Engine 2 Features: (Coming Soon)
- Improved Animation System
- Box2d
- Improved Collision System
- Improved UI System
- Improved Editor
- Audio System Improvements
- Tension2D Render Pipeline Upgrades
- Sprite batching
- Input System Wrapper
- Asset Manager Improvements

I hope to work my way to eventually implement a 3rd rendering pipeline for 3D. Hopefully when Vertex Engine 3 is developed.

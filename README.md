-= VERTEX ENGINE 2 =-

Vertex is a custom game engine made with C++ & OpenGL. Currently it only supports 2D but is planned to support 3D later in development.
The engine is currently a code based only framework, however an editor is in active development with plans to support both code based & editor based
frameworks.



PLEASE NOTE:

Vertex requires visual studio 2019 to work! The engine will be adjusted for newer versions of visual studio later in its development.
